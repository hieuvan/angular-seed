# Assessment Builder App

Assuming that `npm` is installed in your machine, to set up simply run

    $ npm install
    $ node_modules/bower/bin/bower install

After the setup is complete run and leave active in one of the terminal window:

    $ node_modules/grunt/bin/grunt serve

`Requirejs` configuration is in `app.config.js`. It loads all the dependencies listed in the bower automatically and bootstraps `angular`. Any dependencies added to `bower` should be automatically loaded.
